Came up with the idea for this game while lying in bed. I hope it is going ot be as fun as I imagine gameplay wise. It would be a bummer if it isn't
## 6/27/25
Thought more about game and how it would work and started drawing assets
## 6/28/25 
Drew a significant amount of assets for the game
## 6/29/25
Wrote up a pitch/game design document for this game and showed it to people. And decided on a fix for how you could just constantly cut from the bottom. SO the terrain will need to be randomly generated with a curve and a low point or something. made easy tileset for that. Programming that would be the hard part.
## 6/30/25
Created a tileset that should supposedly work for the random terrain generation I thought of yesterday and created TODO list.
